python main.py graph1.txt
The chromatic number of the graph is 3.

python main.py graph1.txt -k 3
K (3) is greater than or equal to the number of vertices (3) in the graph. Without computation we can say that the graph can be colored using at most k colors.

python main.py graph1.txt -k 2
The graph cannot be colored using at most 2 colors.

python main.py graph1.txt -k 1
The graph cannot be colored using at most 1 colors.

python main.py graph1.txt -k 0
By definition graph cannot be colored using 0 colors.
