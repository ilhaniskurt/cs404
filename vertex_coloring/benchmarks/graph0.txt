python main.py graph0.txt
The chromatic number of the graph is 3.

python main.py graph0.txt -k 10
K (10) is greater than or equal to the number of vertices (9) in the graph. Without computation we can say that the graph can be colored using at most k colors.

python main.py graph0.txt -k 4
The graph can be colored using at most 4 colors.

python main.py graph0.txt -k 3
The graph can be colored using at most 3 colors.

python main.py graph0.txt -k 2
The graph cannot be colored using at most 2 colors.

python main.py graph0.txt -k 0
By definition graph cannot be colored using 0 colors.
